# Subway Route Data Extraction with Overpass API

### Overview
This project demonstrates how to extract, process, and visualize subway route data using the Overpass API, NetworkX, and Folium. The project focuses on creating a subway map for the Berlin subway system, showcasing routes and stations extracted directly from OpenStreetMap.

### Features
- **Overpass API Integration**: Extract real-time subway route data for Berlin.
- **Graph Representation**: Build and visualize a network graph of subway stations and routes using NetworkX.
- **Interactive Map**: Display subway routes on an interactive map using Folium, with hover functionality to display station names.
